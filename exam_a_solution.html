<!-- ============================================================ -->
<div class="question-box">
<h2>First Question <span class="points-badge">10 Points</span></h2>

<div class="question-text">
If the vaccination for Covid 19 is produced in competitive market, the cost of the vaccination for each vaccinated person at equilibrium point is 2000 LE. At the previous price, the percentage of the vaccinated persons is 60% of total population (100 Million). According to government estimation, the marginal external benefit of producing and consuming vaccine is 600 LE and there is no marginal external cost. The efficient level of vaccinated persons will be satisfied when the number of vaccinated persons reaches 80% of population, and at this case the new efficient price is 1700 LE.
</div>

<div class="answer-section">
<h3>Given Data:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Competitive market for Covid-19 vaccination</li>
    <li>No external cost &rarr; <strong>MSC = MPC</strong></li>
    <li>Positive externality exists &rarr; <strong>MEB = 600 LE per vaccination</strong></li>
    <li>Equilibrium: Q<sub>1</sub> = 60% &times; 100M = <strong>60 Million</strong>, P<sub>1</sub> = <strong>2,000 LE</strong></li>
    <li>Efficient level: Q<sub>2</sub> = 80% &times; 100M = <strong>80 Million</strong>, Consumer Price (P<sub>3</sub>) = <strong>1,700 LE</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Relationships:</h3>
<div class="formula-box">
    MSB = MPB + MEB (since there IS external benefit)<br>
    MSC = MPC (since there is NO external cost)<br>
    At Market Equilibrium: MPB = MPC<br>
    At Efficient Point: MSB = MSC
</div>

<h3>A) Graphical Determination of Equilibrium Quantity and Price</h3>
<p>The market equilibrium occurs at point <strong>E1</strong> where the demand curve (MPB) intersects the supply curve (MPC = MSC):</p>
<div class="result-box">
    <strong>Equilibrium Point E1:</strong><br>
    Quantity: Q<sub>1</sub> = 60 Million vaccinations<br>
    Price: P<sub>1</sub> = 2,000 LE
</div>

<div class="chart-container">
    <img src="charts/exam_a_q1_positive_externality.png" alt="Positive Externality in Vaccination Market">
</div>

<h3>B) Efficient Point (Quantity &amp; Price)</h3>
<p>The efficient point occurs at <strong>E2</strong> where MSB = MSC. Since MEB = 600 LE, the MSB curve is 600 LE above the MPB curve at every quantity.</p>

<div class="result-box">
    <strong>Efficient Point E2:</strong><br>
    Quantity: Q<sub>2</sub> = 80 Million vaccinations<br>
    Producer Price (on supply curve): P<sub>2</sub> = 2,300 LE<br>
    Consumer Price (after subsidy): P<sub>3</sub> = 1,700 LE
</div>

<p><strong>Verification:</strong> Producer price P<sub>2</sub> &minus; Consumer price P<sub>3</sub> = 2,300 &minus; 1,700 = 600 = MEB &check;</p>

<h3>C) Suitable Government Policy</h3>
<p>The suitable government policy is a <strong>corrective subsidy</strong> equal to the MEB per unit:</p>
<div class="formula-box">
    Corrective Subsidy per unit = MEB = 600 LE per vaccination
</div>
<p>This subsidy shifts the demand curve (MPB) upward by 600 LE to become the MSB curve. The new market equilibrium moves from E1 (inefficient) to E2 (efficient), increasing vaccinations from 60M to 80M.</p>

<h3>D) Effects of Government Intervention</h3>

    <tr><td>Quantity</td><td>60 Million</td><td>80 Million</td><td>&uarr; 20 Million</td></tr>
</table>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Consumer:</strong> Consumers pay less (1,700 instead of 2,000 LE) and consume more (80M instead of 60M). Consumer surplus <strong>increases</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Producer:</strong> Producers receive more (2,300 instead of 2,000 LE) and produce more (80M instead of 60M). Producer surplus <strong>increases</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Government:</strong> Total subsidy cost = Q<sub>2</sub> &times; Subsidy per unit = 80M &times; 600 = <strong>48 Billion LE</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Society achieves <strong>efficiency gains</strong> equal to the triangular area E1E2E3, by moving from the inefficient market equilibrium to the efficient output level.</li>

<div class="question-box">
<h2>Third Question <span class="points-badge">25 Points</span></h2>

<div class="question-text">
Mention true or false with justification (ONLY 5 statements in-class &amp; the rest are take-home questions):
</div>

<div class="answer-section">

<!-- Statement 1 -->
<h4>1. "Applying tax holiday as a tax incentive without some constraints may contradict with achieving economic development in the society."</h4>
<p class="true-label">TRUE</p>
<p><strong>Justification:</strong> Tax holidays, while designed to attract investment, may contradict economic development if applied without constraints because:</p>
<ul>
    <li>They can attract short-term, non-productive investment that disappears when the holiday expires</li>
    <li>They may cause revenue losses that reduce the government's ability to finance public goods and services essential for development</li>
    <li>Without constraints, they can be exploited through tax avoidance schemes</li>
    <li>They may create unfair competition between existing taxpaying businesses and new tax-exempt ones</li>
</ul>
<div class="warning-box">Note: Specific details about tax holiday constraints are not extensively covered in the provided lecture notes, but the general principles of taxation and government finance support this answer.</div>

<!-- Statement 2 -->
<h4>2. "There is no difference between the concept of state budget according to classical view and according to Keynesian view."</h4>
<p class="false-label">FALSE</p>
<p><strong>Justification (from Chapter 1 - State Budget):</strong></p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Classical View</th><th>Keynesian View</th></tr>
    <tr><td>A <strong>financial document</strong> representing expected revenues and expenditures, authorized by legislation authority.</td>
        <td>A <strong>financial plan</strong> for government activities reflecting predictions for revenues and expenses, to achieve society's targets (economic growth, social equity, economic stability), prepared by government, authorized by legislation authority.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Budget's role is limited to <strong>financial</strong> (revenue collection and expenditure)</td>
        <td>Budget's role extends to <strong>economic, social, and financial</strong> targets</td></tr>
</table>

<!-- Statement 3 -->
<h4>3. "If the income tax function is T = 0.25Y, so ATR will be greater than MTR, and this tax will affect positively social equity. (Use suitable graph)"</h4>
<p class="false-label">FALSE</p>
<p><strong>Justification (from Lecture 4 - Tax Rate Structure):</strong></p>
<p>If T = 0.25Y (proportional tax with no exemption):</p>
<div class="formula-box">
    ATR = T / Y = 0.25Y / Y = 0.25 = 25%<br>
    MTR = dT / dY = 0.25 = 25%<br>
    Therefore: <strong>ATR = MTR = 25%</strong> (they are EQUAL, not ATR > MTR)
</div>
<p>This is a <strong>proportional (flat) tax</strong> where both ATR and MTR are constant and equal at 25%. It does NOT positively affect social equity because:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Both rich and poor pay the same percentage (25%)</li>
    <li>A progressive tax (not proportional) is needed to promote social equity</li>
    <li>From the lecture: "A progressive income tax especially progressive by brackets is considered an effective tax to decrease the gap between rich people and poor people"</li>
</ul>
<div class="chart-container">
    <img src="charts/exam_a_q3_proportional_tax.png" alt="Proportional Tax T=0.25Y Graph">
</div>

<!-- Statement 4 -->
<h4>4. "From investor point of view, tax savings are the same whether under applying carrying loss forward or carrying loss backward."</h4>
<p class="false-label">FALSE</p>
<p><strong>Justification:</strong> Carrying loss forward and carrying loss backward differ from the investor's point of view due to the <strong>time value of money</strong>:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Carrying loss backward:</strong> The investor applies the loss against previous years' taxable income and receives an immediate tax refund. The tax savings are realized sooner.</li>
    <li><strong>Carrying loss forward:</strong> The investor applies the loss against future years' taxable income. The tax savings are deferred to future periods.</li>
    <li>Due to the time value of money, receiving tax savings earlier (backward) is worth more in present value terms than receiving them later (forward).</li>
</ul>
<div class="out-of-scope">The specific mechanics of carrying loss forward vs backward are not extensively detailed in the provided lecture notes, but the answer follows from the time value of money principle used in tax savings calculations.</div>

<!-- Statement 5 -->
<h4>5. "There are different forms of government intervention in the market for solving the different reasons of market failure."</h4>
<p class="true-label">TRUE</p>
<p><strong>Justification (from Ch.3 Externalities &amp; Lecture 4):</strong></p>
<p>Different forms of market failure require different government interventions:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Market Failure</th><th>Government Intervention</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Negative Externalities</td><td>Corrective Taxes (e.g., carbon tax, pollution tax)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Positive Externalities</td><td>Corrective Subsidies (e.g., vaccination subsidies)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Monopolistic Power</td><td>Anti-trust regulation, breaking up monopolies</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Public Goods (Free Rider)</td><td>Direct government provision, taxation</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Information Asymmetry</td><td>Disclosure requirements, regulation</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Pollution</td><td>Pollution permits (cap and trade systems)</td></tr>
</table>

<!-- Statement 6 -->
<h4>6. "There are different difficulties for applying assets revaluation as tax incentive especially at the developing countries."</h4>
<p class="true-label">TRUE</p>
<p><strong>Justification:</strong> Asset revaluation as a tax incentive faces several difficulties in developing countries:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lack of active and efficient markets to determine fair market values</li>
    <li>Absence of reliable valuation standards and qualified appraisers</li>
    <li>High inflation rates that make revaluation complex and potentially unfair</li>
    <li>Weak institutional capacity to administer and verify revaluations</li>
    <li>Risk of manipulation to inflate asset values for tax benefits</li>
</ul>
<div class="out-of-scope">Asset revaluation as a specific tax incentive is not covered in the provided lecture notes. The answer draws on general principles of taxation in developing countries.</div>

<!-- Statement 7 -->
<h4>7. "According to progressive tax by classes and by brackets, each taxpayer will subject to different tax rates."</h4>
<p class="false-label">FALSE</p>
<p><strong>Justification (from Lecture 4 - Progressive Tax Rate):</strong></p>
<p>This statement is only <strong>partially correct</strong>:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Progressive by brackets:</strong> Each taxpayer's income is divided into multiple brackets, and each bracket is subject to a different tax rate. So YES, a taxpayer faces different rates for different portions of income. &check;</li>
    <li><strong>Progressive by classes:</strong> Each taxpayer's <em>entire</em> income is subject to <strong>only ONE tax rate</strong> based on which class their total income falls into. The taxpayer does NOT face different rates. &cross;</li>
</ul>
<p>From the lecture: "Depending on this tax each taxpayer's income subject to just only one tax rate, but this taxpayer subject to many rates in the progressive tax by brackets."</p>

<!-- Statement 8 -->
<h4>8. "There are many difficulties of applying 'Benefit Principle' for distributing tax burden."</h4>
<p class="true-label">TRUE</p>
<p><strong>Justification (from Lecture 4 - Tax Burden Distribution):</strong></p>
<p>The Benefit Principle faces several difficulties:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Free rider problem:</strong> Each person doesn't desire to declare their benefit received from pure public goods.</li>
    <li><strong>Measurement difficulty:</strong> It is very difficult to determine and measure the marginal benefit received by individuals from pure public goods.</li>
    <li><strong>Incentive problem:</strong> Even if a method exists to measure marginal benefit, individuals have little or no incentive to declare their true benefits.</li>
    <li><strong>Limited applicability:</strong> Only possible in very small communities where individuals know each other.</li>
</ol>

<!-- Statement 9 -->
<h4>9. "If the coefficient of excludability is 0.7 and coefficient of Rivalry is zero, so this service should be congestible public service. (Use suitable graph)"</h4>
<p class="false-label">FALSE</p>
<p><strong>Justification:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Excludability = 0.7 (highly excludable)</li>
    <li>Rivalry = 0 (non-rival)</li>
    <li>A <strong>congestible public service</strong> would have <em>low</em> excludability and <em>some</em> rivalry (congestion means the good becomes rival as more people use it).</li>
    <li>With high excludability (0.7) and zero rivalry, this is more like a <strong>club good</strong> (e.g., satellite TV, toll-free highway at off-peak) &mdash; excludable but non-rival.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<!-- Statement 10 -->
<h4>10. "The monopolist behavior distorts the efficiency in allocation of resources, as he will produce more than the efficient level and sell at a price higher than the efficient one."</h4>
<p class="false-label">FALSE</p>
<p><strong>Justification (from Ch.3 - Monopoly section):</strong></p>
<p>The statement is <strong>half right and half wrong</strong>:</p>
<ul>
    <li>&check; The monopolist <strong>does</strong> sell at a price <strong>higher</strong> than the efficient one &mdash; this part is correct.</li>
    <li>&cross; However, the monopolist produces <strong>LESS</strong> than the efficient level, not more. The monopolistic power <em>reduces</em> output below the efficient quantity.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the lecture (Ch.3): "The monopolistic power in the market reduces the amount of output less than the efficient level." The monopolist restricts output to increase price and maximize profit. The equilibrium of the monopolist is at MR = MPC, which yields a lower quantity than the efficient level where MSB = MSC.</p>

<h3>C) Reasons of Market Failure</h3>
<p>The free market system fails to achieve efficiency in resource allocation due to several reasons:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Externalities:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Negative externalities</strong> (e.g., pollution from factories): When external costs exist, MSC > MPC, and the market overproduces relative to the efficient level.</li>
            <li><strong>Positive externalities</strong> (e.g., vaccinations): When external benefits exist, MSB > MPB, and the market underproduces relative to the efficient level.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Public Goods &amp; Free Rider Problem:</strong> Pure public goods are non-excludable and non-rival. The free rider problem prevents the market from providing them efficiently because individuals can benefit without paying.</li>
    <li><strong>Monopolistic Power:</strong> Monopolists restrict output below the efficient level and charge prices above the efficient price, leading to deadweight loss.</li>
    <li><strong>Information Asymmetry:</strong> When buyers and sellers have different information about the quality or value of goods, markets may not function efficiently.</li>
</ol>

<h3>D) Differences Between Pure Public Goods and Pure Private Goods</h3>
<table>
    <tr><th>Characteristic</th><th>Pure Public Goods</th><th>Pure Private Goods</th></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Excludability</strong></td><td>Non-excludable: Cannot prevent non-payers from consuming</td><td>Excludable: Can prevent non-payers from consuming</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Rivalry</strong></td><td>Non-rival: One person's consumption does not reduce availability for others</td><td>Rival: One person's consumption reduces availability for others</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Free Rider Problem</strong></td><td>Present: Individuals can benefit without paying</td><td>Absent: Must pay to consume</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Market Provision</strong></td><td>Market fails to provide efficiently; government provision needed</td><td>Market provides efficiently through price mechanism</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Examples</strong></td><td>National defense, lighthouses, public broadcasting</td><td>Food, clothing, electronics</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Pricing</strong></td><td>Cannot be priced by the market (MB is concealed)</td><td>Priced by market supply and demand</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>B) Assumptions of Free Market System</h3>
<p>The free market system is based on several key assumptions:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Perfect Competition:</strong> Many buyers and sellers, none with market power to influence prices.</li>
    <li><strong>No Externalities:</strong> All costs and benefits are reflected in market prices (MSC = MPC and MSB = MPB).</li>
    <li><strong>Perfect Information:</strong> All participants have complete and accurate information about products, prices, and market conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>Property Rights:</strong> Well-defined and enforceable property rights exist for all goods and resources.</li>
    <li><strong>Free Entry and Exit:</strong> Firms can freely enter or exit the market without barriers.</li>
    <li><strong>No Public Goods:</strong> All goods are excludable and rival (private goods) so the price mechanism works.</li>
</ol>
